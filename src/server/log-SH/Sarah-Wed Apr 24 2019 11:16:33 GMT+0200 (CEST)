Our goal is to observe users solving realistic tasks and be able to qualitatively compare the results.  We conducted a structured observation \\cite{structobs}, a quasi-experiment \\cite{quasi} that combines controlled conditions in realistic tasks, seeking to enforce external validity. Structured observations do not start from a hypothesis, but are designed to identify novel behaviour. We want to probe if there are different user strategies, and how does \\KnotationTwo{} support them.    \\vspace{-2mm}  \\subsection{Participants} We recruited six professional contemporary choreographers (5 women, 1 man). P1 brought a collaborator (P1C), who was also a choreographer and went through the activities with him, working as a team.  Participants had between 3 and 47 years of experience (average including P1C: 19.42).   % P1: 16, P1C: 30, P2: 20, P3: 5, P4: 47, P5: 3, P6: 15. } The authors attended the study as observers. One of the authors, who is also a choreographer and dancer, acted as a volunteer dancer. \\added{We paid the travel expenses of a non-local choreographer, and offered all participants a lunch in a nice local restaurant.}  %------------------------- %Details about participants: They all use paper in their choreographic process, and video for recording themselves or rehearsals with dancers (though P1 rarely does it), and two also do video editing.  %Three participants mentioned sketches as part of the artefacts they generate when they compose a piece, and four referred to music or sound, sometimes in collaboration with composers.  %P1: Paper, testing at the studio, rarely video, Sources: exhibitions, walking, documentaries.  %P2: paper, video, photos, paintings, sketches, music. Sources: readings, walking in the forrest, conversations, conferences. It takes her two years for a piece, first year gathering information, second year \"work\". Sometimes the piece's music composer creates the music before and she needs to change her strategy and depart from this constraint.  %P3: mostly videos, Adobe Premier for video footage, paper, sketches, sometimes uses sound: she records her voice to generate a rhythm, especially in flamenco dance.  %P4: paper, sketches, videos.  %P5: films her impro sessions, video editing tools where she reverses videos and adds music, annotations on paper ``to leave a documented trace'', midi mockups that the composer sends her and she can then ``translate the music schematically, to transmit it to the dancers''. She said she's still defining her method, and that her notes are personal and she doesn't show them to the dancers. % P6: free writing, journaling, notes, collects stuff to use as patterns to generate material, video of all the rehearsals (but then doesn't go back to it too often), audio recordings if collaborating with a composer.} %-------------------------  \\vspace{-2mm} \\subsection{Hardware and Software} The study uses \\KnotationTwo{}, described in Section \\emph{\\nameref{KnotationRefined}}.  Each participant is given a 12.9'' iPad Pro\\textsuperscript{TM} running iOS 10.3, and the Apple Pencil{TM} as an input device.  Participants can save their progress by pressing a \\emph{save} button at a corner of the screen. In addition, their work is automatically saved each 5 minutes.   \\vspace{-2mm}  \\subsection{Setup}  We ran three sessions in a local dance studio, with two participants each. Participants were able to use their tablet in any position in the studio, which had chairs, a bench and a table.  \\vspace{-2mm} \\subsection{Procedure} The study includes five activities: \\emph{training}, \\emph{composing}, \\emph{transmitting}, \\emph{transforming}, and \\emph{debriefing}.  A session takes between two and three hours.  \\vspace{-2mm} \\subsubsection{1. Training (up to 30 minutes)} The two participants in the session receive a live, 8-minute scripted demonstration of \\KnotationTwo{}'s main features. Next, they are given an iPad Pro and an Apple Pencil and play with \\KnotationTwo{} until they feel comfortable with it.  The authors answer participants' questions at any moment.  \\vspace{-2mm} \\subsubsection{2. Composing (30 - 60 minutes)} This activity consists in creating a brief choreographic fragment for any number of dancers.  Participants are told they can interact with \\KnotationTwo{} as much as they want, deciding in which part of the creative process to use it, during 30 minutes. The authors agree with participants on when to pass to the next activity.  \\vspace{-2mm} \\subsubsection{3. Transmitting (15 minutes)} Participants take turns to explain each other what they did during the \\emph{composing} activity, for up to 15 minutes.  They can ask each other questions during this time.  \\vspace{-2mm} \\subsubsection{4. Transforming (30 - 60 minutes)} Participants are shown an online-available video fragment of Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker's piece \\emph{Drumming Live} and are given a printed copy of the piece's floorplan (a graphical representation of the golden rectangle), since these are two artefacts that her dance company uses to transmit the piece. This activity involves taking a choreographic aspect of their choice from the video or floorplan, and modifying it to match the style of their fragment in the \\emph{composing} activity. Similarly to that activity, participants take 30 minutes and more time is added if necessary.   \\vspace{-2mm} \\subsubsection{5. Debriefing (15 minutes)} The authors debrief the participants for 15 minutes to wrap up the session.  \\vspace{-2mm} \\subsection{Data collection} We recorded each of the three sessions with a camera placed on a tripod in a corner of the studio.  We also took close-up videos, pictures and hand-written notes.  We logged the interaction of the participants with \\KnotationTwo{}. We anonymised the data and refer to participants as P1-P6, and P1C.  \\vspace{-2mm} \\subsection{Data analysis} During the debriefing, we asked participants to explain each choreographic object. We analysed our notes, pictures, and videos, to identify unique practices and interesting appropriation cases, and to find common patterns across participants and activities.   \\vspace{-2mm}  \\section{Results and discussion}  % Mai: I'm commenting out this paragraph because it doesn't give valuable information. %The time spent in the \\emph{composing} and \\emph{transforming} activities varied across sessions, according to the participants' interest.  %In particular, participants in the first session did not complete the \\emph{transforming} activity due to time restrictions, since a longer time was spent at the beginning.  Participants kept the iPads on the floor most of the time, and occasionally on their laps.  They picked them up only when standing to film dance movements. Most participants (5/6) filmed the movements they created, and most of them (4/5) imported the videos into \\KnotationTwo{}.  %details: P6 didn't film and P2 did but didn't include the video % Mai: if we have the time it could be interesting to say how many times each participant tapped on a video knot to show the video, in each activity. Only one participant (P4) used pictures of her fragment. % Mai: same with pictures, unless they were always visible, or just say that. %detail: All the features included in the study were used by at least one participant. <-- I need to check that in the logs because I don't remember if they actually extracted a floorplan's structure, for example.  In the \\emph{transmitting} activity, participants gathered around each device on the floor and used it to explain to the others what they had composed.  This included playing videos in \\KnotationTwo{}, making mid-air gestures over the iPad, and occasionally marking movements. %\\mai{Is it unfair to present it like this? We didn't instruct them to teach the others the fragment. Is this behaviour an artefact of our procedure? Should we also say that?}  We divide our findings in two parts: insights about the choreographers' processes in the context of using \\KnotationTwo{}; and specific findings about the use of the tool.   \\subsection{Findings about the choreographic process}  \\subsubsection{Dance-then-record versus Record-then-dance}  As we expected, participants started from their own initial ideas and followed their own process.  For example, P1 parted from the idea of the \\emph{``the sane''} and \\emph{``the crazy''} and used \\KnotationTwo{} collaboratively with P1C, writing words and symbolic sketches, to finally film six \\emph{``elements''} and experiment with their order and repetition on a timeline.   Still, we observed specific strategies across participants, according to their personal style. Some participants (2/6) started to dance directly and only used \\KnotationTwo{} at the end of the process: We call this strategy \\emph{``dance-then-record''}. One participant did the opposite (\\emph{``record-then-dance''}), playing with the tool to plan different combinations of trajectories and movements, and only then performed the fragment. The rest (3/6) went back and forth between dancing and the tool.  % Mai: Is the following interesting data to give? --> We do know that the dance-then-record participant (P4) usually works like that, and the record-then-dance participants too (P3 and P5). Should we explain this? For example, P5 said that because studio time is expensive, she usually starts on paper first and when she has a clearer idea she goes to the studio with the dancers and what she prepared. P6 (one of the 3 with mixed strategies) said that if she is with dancers she interacts with them, but if she is alone, she goes back and forth between paper and the body.  P3's and P4's processes were particularly contrasting.  P3 sat on the floor with the iPad, thinking for some minutes.  Then she gave an oral indication to our volunteer dancer and defined the main\\emph{ ``keyframes''} for her fragment in \\KnotationTwo{}. P4, instead, started dancing right away.  Only after testing movements for several minutes, she asked to be filmed while performing them.  She used \\KnotationTwo{} at the end of this process to capture her ideas.  Although the \\emph{transforming} activity started with the participants watching the video of \\emph{Drumming Live} on their devices, after that they consistently continued with the strategy they had adopted in the \\emph{composing} activity. We observed, however, longer periods of interaction with the tool, since they had created interactive content and they were playing with it to accommodate the transformations they generated in this new activity.   %Mai: TODO Add table with number of times they used each feature, grouped by strategy, if the results are interesting. The table can give us insight on a possible experiment to do for testing how Knotation supports a particular strategy. If we're not adding the table, then we're missing some sort of conclusion/discussion about what this finding means. Something in the lines of answering: is Knotation actually supporting all this? What is lacking? What could be tested?  \\subsubsection{Personal interpretation and varied degrees of formality}  %Mai: I'm not sure why this is one category and not two separate. Participants had their own personal interpretation of the content they produced and the system's feedback. For example, P6 appropriated the meaning of trajectories on a floorplan.  She wrote five words and drew a set of symbols for each one, in five floorplans.  The symbols did represent trajectories \\emph{``but not in a horizontal floorplan space''} (P6).    %Mai: the following is the type of finding that R2 says it could be an artefact of sketching and not of using Knotation. I agree, so I'm commenting it out. It's not clear how Knotation supports this, it's just not getting in the middle, and not because of a particular behaviour of the system, but as a result of having a free canvas: %P1 and P5 described annotations they had added close to their timelines, as being part of the timelines. %For example, P1 and P1C created a timeline under the sketches, and positioned video knots on the line, under each symbol.  %Although from the system's perspective there was no relation between these elements, the link was clear for participants because of the elements' spatial proximity, and it was captured in their documents.  During the debriefing, participants in different sessions spontaneously reflected on the level of formality and detail they used to define their choreographic objects. For example, P4 expressed she was purposely imprecise when annotating her fragment.  She explicitly talked about the tool allowing a degree of \\emph{``informality''}: \\emph{``For me, since I love informal things, it works, but it also works for something more formal, more precise''}, referring to P3's use of the tool.  P1C also said that it permits \\emph{``being informal''}, and as a consequence \\emph{``it stays open to interpretation''}.  %Mai: I don't know where to put this, but it's related to Study 1's \"legends\".  Above a floorplan, P5 drew symbols that represented the idea of \\emph{``leaning''}. She added a portal to the floorplan and inside the portal she redrew the symbols and added several tagged knots to explain the different states. I think this is an interesting example of symbolic sketch that could constitute a personal language, and motivate future work.  \\subsubsection{Participants quickly appropriated Knotation} Several participants appropriated timelines and floorplans.  For example, P6 drew a spiral-shaped timeline: \\emph{``But the shape of the timeline is the spatial trajectory''}. P1 and P1C overlapped clips so they would appear as one seamless video when playing the timeline. %P2 drew some short trajectories outside of a floorplan so they would not be animated, indicating that the dancer was off the stage at the beginning and at the end. P3 used floorplans to define keyframes (diagrams with dancers' locations at a given moment, as seen from above), representing dancers with knots and transitions with lines. %P3 wanted to use \\KnotationTwo{} to express keyframes and find the transitions.    %Despite the lack of a specific feature to do that, she appropriated floorplans, creating a set of knots representing the initial positions of the dancers, then cloned and placed them in the final locations, drawing a trajectory in between. %P2 set the qualities for the movement with a combination of pencil-written text and quality attributes. %Even though we did not design \\KnotationTwo{} considering bimanual interaction, P6 hid knots' attributes with her non-dominant hand while drawing with the pen in her other hand. \\mai{I'm not sure if this belongs to appropriation.} \\begin{figure} \\centering \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\columnwidth]{images/p5-study3.png} \\vspace{-2mm} \\caption{Study 3: Complex structures with \\KnotationTwo{} (P5).} \\label{fig:p5-study3} \\end{figure}  One participant (P5) appropriated \\KnotationTwo{} to create complex structures in the \\emph{transforming} activity: She drew a floorplan and a timeline per dancer as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:p5-study3}, with \\emph{``properties''} (e.g. unison relationships) that should be read vertically, as in a \\emph{``rhythmic score''}. %She wanted to create a \\emph{``rhythmic score''}, %, so she drew a horizontal timeline at the right side of each floorplan.  %She specified properties on the timelines using knots (for example a unison relationship), that should be read vertically.  %She wanted \\emph{``a tool similar to the timeline''}, \\emph{``easily visible''}, and that can reveal \\emph{``what should happen at a given moment for each dancer''}. %Such a tool was not explicitly supported in \\KnotationTwo{}, so P5 appropriated the available functionality. She cloned portals to define \\emph{``shared scores''} for dancers at the proper locations on their timelines. %To indicate that dancers A and B had to do the same movement but at a different speed or moment, she added a portal below dancer A's timeline and indicated its scope. %Then she cloned the portal to specify a \\emph{``shared score''}, where she annotated commonalities and differences, and placed the cloned portal in the proper position below dancer B's timeline. %P5 combined the spatial and the temporal aspects of her composition in the same page but in different parts of it. She also drew a curve over each timeline to represent the levels with respect to the floor.  This story illustrates how P5 created her own sophisticated structure to decompose and combine the three dimensions and time, in a 2D landscape. %P5 said she was trying to \\emph{``visualise the relationships in space between the dancers [in the floorplans], and then the relationships in time, by reading them vertically''} on the timelines.  % P5 made emphasis in \\emph{``creating a tool easily visible to create, for example, unison''} between dancers.  %P5 used tag knots to indicate the direction of the gaze for each dancer at different moments of the fragment.  % During the debriefing, P5 said she would like to be able to ``read the timelines'' over a musical score which is shared by everyone'' (meaning all the dancers).  %P1 and P1C discovered the \\emph{Relationships} menu, and imagined how they could use the \\emph{mirroring} relationship to indicate that a dancer has to mirror another dancer's trajectory. %P1 and P1C proposed to put a relationship knot on each dancer's timeline, and the position of the knot on the line would indicate the beginning of its scope. %\\mai{Here it is not clear how they would indicate which two dancers or timelines were affected by the same relationship.}   \\subsubsection{Knotation as a tool for gathering material about the piece}  P1C remarked: \\emph{``I find really interesting to be able to gather imagery easily, that is instantly playable, with your hypothesis of time and space''}, and P1 added that \\emph{``instead of having fifteen thousand notes, your have it here all assembled''}. In the same direction, P3 explained that for her, there is a \\emph{``time of creation''} and a \\emph{``time of technology''}, and that \\emph{``a tool like this allows you to join those times''}.  Interestingly, P4 suggested the name \\emph{``Knowtation''} because it collects the knowledge about a piece.  However, the fact that the content is displayed on a 12.9\" screen can be a limitation for some users.  P2 mentioned she wanted \\emph{``to keep everything visible''} but the screen size was an issue: \\emph{``I have the same problem with the computer''}.   Participants brought up the problem of navigating the material for a complete piece. P3 referred to the \\emph{``arborescence''} nature of a piece's \\emph{``architecture''}.  She wanted to use portals to visualise the tree-like structure of a piece, since for her \\emph{``there is always a back and forth between the global and the detail''} (P3). %defining a portal sometimes as a way to navigate towards a more detailed view of a particular choreographic object, and sometimes towards a more global view of the piece. Participants in Study 2 had also raised this issue, which \\KnotationTwo{} did not tackle and we leave for future work.  \\subsubsection{Knotation as a tool for assessing choreographic choices}  Participants appropriated errors to generate new ideas. For example, P1 and P1C linked several knots to the same video by mistake.  Interestingly, they appropriated this error and decided to use it as as a way to discover \\emph{``interesting patterns''} (P1C).  P1C said that visualising several times the same element made them discover possibilities for generating interesting rhythms and dynamics, as well as considering \\emph{``extensions''} of the element. %\\mai{She described the extensions with gestures and noises with her voice and hands, but not with words, so I don't know how to give examples here.} According to P1C, \\emph{``you don't find that in the videos you film''}.  P1C described hers and P1's use of the timelines as \\emph{``a way to see the available choices''}. She also pointed out a possible use of \\KnotationTwo{} as a way of \\emph{``validating things before testing them''} in the studio.  %For example, she would like to set different types of relationships, such as having two dancers perform the same element with certain delay, and \\emph{``see if the tool can play the videos''} accordingly.  In the debriefing she stated that she finds \\KnotationTwo{} \\emph{``a file easy to rework, to be brought up again''}. %\"Retravailler\" and \"ressortir\" in French.   For P4, the tool \\emph{``gives a vision that is more real''}, thanks to the \\emph{``simultaneity of video''} on screen.  P5 tried to \\emph{``see what were all the possibilities, because when you're trying to write [a piece] on paper, you can't pass from paper to video, or paper to duration\"}.    %I removed the following because it wasn't clear from their comments if they think Knotation supports that. However this could be used for future work / implications for design. % P3 and P4 referred to the importance of expressing a range of interconnected ideas before making choreographic choices. % P4 said that when reflecting about a piece, \\emph{``you do not do it linearly, as a succession of things''}, but more \\emph{``like a fan''}. % Similarly, P3 explained she creates structures \\emph{``like mind maps''} where she lays out her ideas for a piece, \\emph{``when you do not know yet the architecture''}.  % P3 mentioned she would like to, for example, take an existing timeline and reshape it into a circle to represent a loop. % P2 and P6 wanted to clone a floorplan including its trajectories, to reuse it while varying parameters such as the orientation of the trajectories.  % P6 added many knots with tags, which represented movements, into a spiral-shaped timeline. %, which conformed \\emph{``a base vocabulary for the dancers''}, with a \\emph{``random ordering of all of those movements, linking them in the phrase as the dancers traverse this area''}. % She wanted to clone the timeline with all its content, and have several copies that she could overlap and play with layering to see the differences, and \\emph{``the relationships between all the dancers over time and space... But all over this one starting constraint of the spatial pattern''}. %She wanted to \\emph{``choose which dancers are in the timeline when, looking at different combinations''}.  %P2 wanted to clone the content of the floorplan (the trajectories), in order to reuse it with variations, for example changing the rhythm and the direction. % In the study version of the tool this was not possible, only the structure could be cloned (i.e. the border and the knots on it), so she had to clone each trajectory.  \\subsubsection{Knotation as a reflective tool} During the \\emph{composing} activity, P5 spontaneously talked about her way of annotating ideas: \\emph{``It's very systematic as a way of writing, very mathematical''}. P1C stated they were \\emph{``trying to do with the tool what we usually do other ways''}. In contrast, P1 said that having \\emph{``so many possibilities''} constantly \\emph{``triggered new ideas''} before he could process his previous ideas, so he \\emph{``got entangled''}. In the \\emph{transmitting} activity, while going over their annotations, P4 remarked the differences between her choreographic process and P3's, as well as between their degree of formality when capturing ideas. %She also pointed out the differences in their use of the spirals in the \\emph{transforming} activity, while going through P3's annotated fragment in \\KnotationTwo{}.  %Mai: A reviewer suggested to delete this subsection. %\\vspace{-2mm} %\\subsection{Knotation in other possible contexts}  %P1C said that \\KnotationTwo{} could be particularly useful for dance students, but also for creative practitioners such as visual artists.  %P4 invited us to deploy it in the conservatory she works at.  %%P3 said it would be interesting to show what she did with \\KnotationTwo{}, to someone who was not present in the session, and see what do they interpret.   \\subsection{Findings about the use of the tool}  \\subsubsection{Knotation's use across activities} \\todo{find better title and remove the whole category if not interesting} In the second part of the \\emph{training}, when participants experimented with the tool for some minutes, they did it in a highly exploratory way, quickly sketching ideas and adding knots to their choreographic objects, discovering and combining the available functionality without a clear goal, trying to get a glimpse of what they could do, without dancing at all.  Surprisingly, one participant (P5) managed to create complex interactive structures with floorplans, timelines, and portals.  \\subsubsection{Participants feedback} During the debriefing, P3 remarked she liked that the tool worked for both hers and P4's choreographic processes, and P4 emphasised she particularly liked that \\emph{``it does not impose a method''}.  %about informality: and added: \\emph{``I like that very much of this piece of software''} (P4). %\\mai{P6 said after the study that we could consider Knotation as an intervention to the choreographic process, rather than a support for it. Because for her, we're having assumptions of time, space, of what the process is and of what choreography is. She said that Knotation didn't help her at all in her process. Should we report it? How?} %From the beginning, P3 said about Knotation: \\emph{``It's a dream''}, and asked us: \\emph{``Do you know how many times I dreamt with having something like this?''}.  \\subsection{Summary} \\todo{rewrite based on new categories and highlighted findings} In summary, Study 3 showed that \\KnotationTwo{} does not impose a choreographic process on the user, easily supporting both \\emph{dance-then-record} and \\emph{record-then-dance strategies}. The reported stories illustrate how it is up to the user to give meaning to both the input and the system's feedback. Moreover, \\KnotationTwo{} avoids premature commitment and lets choreographers change their mind about the meaning of their choreographic objects. Our results suggest that this allowed participants to be as formal (or informal) as they wanted, while their annotations stayed flexible and open to interpretation. Participants used and appropriated \\KnotationTwo{}'s advanced features, including the combination of timelines and floorplans, to represent and explore complex choreographic structures. %Similarly to Study 2, participants suggested more ways of interacting with their choreographic ideas, and a range of other possible domains for the tool, including pedagogical settings with dance students, and opening it to other creative audiences such as visual artists. This study uncovered \\KnotationTwo{}'s potential as a tool for gathering material about a piece and assessing choreographic choices on the go, combining the exploration and documentation of choreographic ideas in a mobile workspace that can be brought to the studio and used with collaborators.  \\vspace{-2mm}  \\subsection{Implications for design} \\todo{Transform this into a more general section that gives implications for design.}  %MAI: I commented a lot of things from this section because it's not adding to the discussion and it looks like the tool was missing a lot of stuff, rather than triggering interaction ideas. Participants wanted greater control over the default choreographic objects, such as floorplans and timelines, and they suggested new possible features to do so. Several participants recognised the need of playing groups of floorplans and timelines. %For example, P1C proposed that the timeline's length could represent a certain lapse, and the position of the video knots could correspond to the moment in which the elements should be performed. P1C and P1 added video knots to floorplan trajectories, and mentioned they would like the videos to be triggered when the animated line passes through each knot. %P2 wanted to play trajectories in order, instead of simultaneously, and also play them backwards, or set their tempo. %\"Reverse\" in French. P4 suggested having \\emph{``non-uniform time''}, for example by defining the acceleration for a trajectory. We discussed the possibility of adding speed controllers defined by functions (for example, an exponential curve drawn by the user) instead of kept constant.  %Participants wanted to personalise their knots more, and count with more types of relationships.  %P3 and P6 would have liked to assign different colours to knots to identify them more quickly, besides the tags that were already available. P1C and P5 wanted to be able to set other types of \\emph{``temporal relationships''}: \\emph{``do the same thing at the same time, or before, or after''} (P5).   Several participants (3/6) wanted to reuse the artefacts they created, in order to generate variations.  They wanted to clone these objects and reuse some of their properties while varying others.  In \\KnotationTwo{}, it was possible to clone at once the structure of an object (for example, a floorplan's border and its attached knots) but not its content (in this case, the trajectories).   This would be trivial to add to the tool and we leave it for future work.  %Similarly to P5 and her \\emph{``rhythmic scores''}, P1C wanted to be able to create one timeline per dancer, specify which elements need to be performed when, and then play both timelines at the same time.  %P3 drew several timelines to represent different aspects of the piece, to avoid cluttering the main timeline. %However, she wanted all the timelines to represent the same amount of time and play in sync. %P1C, P3, and P5 wanted that several timelines could play in sync.  %In the study, they had to play the timelines one by one, introducing a small delay in between. %P1C made emphasis in the need for \\emph{``simultaneity of video''} and the importance of playing clips at the same time. %P4, P5, and P6 remarked the need of playing several floorplans at the same time.  %P5 drew one floorplan for each dancer (with one trajectory each), and organised them vertically.  %She wanted to play them at the same time. %This was not available in Knotation but we later discussed the possibility of drawing a line that passes through all the floorplan knots grouping them, so playing this line would play all the floorplans at the same time. %We did not discuss a name for this new instrument, which we consider for future work.  %Participants wanted more types of data to be available in \\KnotationTwo{}. %P1C asked for features related with the music of the piece, which is not available in the tool yet. %P3 asked if one could import sound, because she records her voice doing rhythms when composing flamenco choreographies.   % P3 used the Apple pencil as she uses a normal pencil, with a series of short strokes. % The version used in the study interpreted each stroke individually, so she had to, for example, redraw the border of a floorplan in one stroke for the system to interpret it as one object.  % She suggested that it should be possible to join the lines and make them part of the same object.  %P3 would mimic the drawing gestures before actually drawing with the pencil, as if rehearsing them.  % P3 wanted to be able to tag video knots, which was not possible in the version used in the study.   % Both P3 and P4 extensively played with the \\emph{speed} and \\emph{duration} attributes.   %P3 asked if she could change the speed of the video playback, because this would be useful for her in her flamenco dance creations.   %She wanted to play a video slowly to visualise very fast movements in a more detailed way. <-- It was possible through a speed's text controller set in 0.5, for example.  %P5 cloned a duration knot and applied it to all the floorplans.","speed":"1","repetitionNumber":"1","iDiv":{},"id":"idCard324104756430","deleted":false}]
